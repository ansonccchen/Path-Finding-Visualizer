# Path Finding Visualizer
Hello! Welcome to my Path Finding Visualizer. Currently, this project supports a couple of popular algorithms listed below; with more to come soon. This project was built using TypeScript with React. [Click here to check it out.](https://ansonccchen.github.io/Path-Finding-Visualizer/ "Path Visualizer")

## Supported Algorithms
### Dijkstra's Algorithm
This is known as the father of all path finding algorithms. It is a **weighted** algorithm that gurantees the shortest path between two nodes.

### Depth-first Search
This is a common algorithm used in many graph/tree problems. It is an **unweighted** algorithm that finds a path between two nodes but does not gurantee the shortest path.

### Breadth-first Search
Another very common algorithm used in graph/tree problems. It is an **unweighted** algorithm that will always find the shortest path between two nodes.  

### A*
This is known as one of the best and most popular path finding algorithms. This algorithm is very similar to Dijkstra's, but with one difference, it uses a heuristic. It is a **weighted** algorithm that gurantees the shortest path between two nodes.
